# GUI K-Means Clustering
## Overview
This Python-based application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for performing K-Means clustering on user-supplied datasets. The GUI offers tools for data input, cluster analysis, and assumption testing to assist in the interpretation of clustering results.
## Features
- **File Upload**: Allows users to input their dataset in Excel format for clustering.
- **Cluster Selection**: User can specify the number of clusters to use in the K-Means algorithm.
- **Centroid Calculation**: Displays the centroids of each cluster after processing the data.
- **Scatter Plot Visualization**: Provides a scatter plot showing the clustered data points and centroids.
- **Assumption Testing**: Includes multicollinearity checks (correlation matrix), Bartlett's test, and KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) test for ensuring the assumptions behind clustering are met.
